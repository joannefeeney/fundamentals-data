# Fundamentals of Data Analytics

This is my repository for my ATU Fundamentals of Data Analytics project & tasks.

I have created two jupyter notebooks, named tasks.ipynb & project.ipynb which contain all my code and findings from my research for this module.

## Project

### Introduction

For this project I will create a notebook investigating the variables and data points within the well-known iris flower data set associated with Ronald A Fisher.

I will discuss the classification of each variable within the data set according to common variable types and scales of measurement in mathematics, statistics and Python. I will also select, demonstrate and explain what I believe to be the most appropriate summary statistics to describe each variable and explain the most appropriate plot(s) for each variable

The Iris dataset includes three flower (iris) species with 50 samples each as well as some properties about each flower. 

The columns in this dataset are:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Class

### Main Body

### Conclusion

In this notebook, I investigated the Iris dataset. My investigation aimed to work out the patterns and characteristics of three species/class of iris flowers: setosa, versicolor and virginica.

I used various data analysis techniques to get some insight into the key attributes of the iris flowers. From scatter plots and pair plots to statistical measures such as mean, max etc., I compared these species. I discovered the distinguishing features of the iris species, such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The outputs provide us with a lot of information on the unique identitifiers of each species.

In summary, the iris dataset has allowed me to use some valuable skills in data analytics and get much more familiar with a subject I hope to use much of in the future.
